# GitHub Application Manager

A linux tool similar to `apt` and `yum` that is used to search for and install applications from GitHub. Works on many different application types that are stored in repos as releases, including:
- deb
- rpm
- AppImage
- Electron (tar/gz)

`gam` will automatically add a command to your `PATH` and if GNOME is installed it will add a shortcut to the application as well. These are automatically removed when uninstalling applications.

***Proud to have made the top spot on [r/github](https://www.reddit.com/r/github) and [r/coolgithubprojects](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects) on launch day.***
